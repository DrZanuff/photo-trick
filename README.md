Photo-Trick is a simple and fun web application designed to demonstrate how to manipulate the user's camera feed using native JavaScript.

## Features

- **Desktop and Mobile Support**: Enjoy the application seamlessly on any device.
- **Interactive Camera Feed**: Leverages native JavaScript capabilities to handle user media.
- **Creative Frames**: Use provided frames to create fun photo opportunities.
- **Image Editing**: Save your photos with added frames for sharing or keeping as memories.

## Tech Stack

- **Frameworks and Tools**:
  - Vite
  - React
